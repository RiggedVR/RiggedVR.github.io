            Rigged Games is just Rigged's games. Rigged (Jake Phillips) is a VR Indie Game Developer, creator of Web-Guy and in future Nexus & Octoseek! Rigged has been creating games since he was 10 years old, starting on Roblox and moving to Unity soon after. Rigged is now 16 and currently working on Octoseek which you can find out more about on the Projects page. Rigged's dream game is Nexus which he's been working on for the past year, inspired by the likes of Half Life & Vertigo / Vertigo 2, a multi-chapter narrative VR game where you learn about a new world as you try and uncover its secrets. Nexus is slowly being developed as Rigged continues to learn and improve with a demo planned for 2023!
