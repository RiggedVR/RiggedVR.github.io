    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 12th September 2024</p>
    <p>
        We at Rigged Games (“Rigged Games,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and shared when you access and use our virtual reality game, <em>Untangled</em> (the "Game"), and any related services (collectively referred to as the "Services"). This policy specifically relates to <em>Untangled</em> and any associated game services, including logging in via PlayFab and interactions within the game.
    </p>
    <p>By using the Game and the Services, you agree to the collection and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>In order to provide you with the best experience when using <em>Untangled</em>, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meta Username:</strong> When you use <em>Untangled</em>, we collect your Meta username. This information helps us identify and authenticate users, personalize your experience, and link you to your account.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> We collect your IP address for PlayFab, a third-party service that manages certain aspects of the Game's functionality, including authentication and logging. This information is used to ensure secure and reliable access to the Game and to maintain server integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware ID:</strong> When logging into PlayFab, we collect your device's unique hardware ID. This information is used solely for authentication purposes and to ensure that your gameplay data is tied to your specific device, improving game security and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected to provide, maintain, and improve the Game and related Services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> To authenticate you and allow you to log in securely using PlayFab.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Functionality:</strong> To operate and manage the Game and any related features, such as in-game progress tracking and achievements.</li>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers, such as PlayFab, to manage game authentication, data storage, and other functionalities necessary for the Game's operation. These providers are bound by contract to protect your information.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please note that we do not handle the storage of your personal data directly.

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion Rights</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services or as required by law. Once your data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data at any time. If you request the deletion of your personal data, we will promptly delete or anonymize the information in accordance with applicable laws, unless the retention of certain information is required for legal or operational purposes (e.g., compliance with legal obligations, resolving disputes, or enforcing our agreements).

    To request the deletion of your personal data, please contact us at riggedingame@gmail.com, and we will take the necessary steps to delete the data held by us and our service providers, including PlayFab.</p>

        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> The right to request corrections to any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> The right to object to the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [Insert Contact Email].</p>
